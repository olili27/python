a fixture is something u can have run before every single test
    @pytest.fixture

its like a setup that gives you a fresh instance or data before every test runs

for data structures that are not in-memory like a real database
    use keyword `yield` before the instance to provide a fixture instance
    then u can later perform a clean up

    -- anything before the yield statement will run before the test runs
    -- anything after the yield will run after the test runs
