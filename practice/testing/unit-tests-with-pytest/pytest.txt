Fixture
a fixture is something u can have run before every single test(not yet sure if it provides a global instance common to all the tests in the test_file)
    @pytest.fixture

    ** i realised the mistake i had done. the storage unit for the class i was testing was a class variable/attribute so it was common to all instances being created

its like a setup that gives you a fresh instance or data before every test runs

for data structures that are not in-memory like a real database
    use keyword `yield` before the instance to provide a fixture instance
    then u can later perform a clean up

    -- anything before the yield statement will run before the test runs
    -- anything after the yield will run after the test runs


Skip a test
    use the pytest.mark.skip decorator

    skip with a condition
    pytest.mark.skipif(condition, reason="")


Mark a test that its going to fail
    use pytest.mark.xfail decorator


values are almost equal: especially when dealing with floats
    assert a == pytest.approx(y, 0.02)
